# Dino Game - Game Dev

(On a mobile device play in landscape orientation for the best experience)

The goal of the game is for the dinosaur to avoid the obstacles by jumping over them. As the dinosaur runs along the desert it will encounter cactuses. If you don't jump over them it's game over. Our dino can perform a low or high jump. A low jump is achieved with a quick tap of the screen or quick press of the space bar. A high jump requires taping the screen longer or pressing the space bar longer.
